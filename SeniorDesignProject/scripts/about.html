        <p>How can identity spark identity when reality favors dependent thinking? In a society that grows around computational consumption and contiguous social media, algorithms are interesting to point out in the context of identifiable technology. My question is: What are the outcomes of simulated identical technology? Unmovingly, the rate of technological expansion is changing and evolving each day. Every day, we become an identity that is merged with programmatic models. This term is equivalent to body dysmorphia, where we think one thing about our body based on the beliefs and thoughts tied to our subconscious. Computational Dysmorphia is similar; it is a term created to foster an ongoing trend where humans Dissociation between their dependent identity(identity-based on mass judgment and mass thought within online communities)  and their pre-influencer identity and describes the psychological effects when interacting with curated digital environments and algorithms that distort how humans perceive their identity and what is worth. In total, Computational Dysmorphia is a phenomenon that leads to a distorted sense of self shaped by cultural trends and digital norms. The goal of this website is to introduce users to the phenomenon of interactiveness and artificial graphics and provide valuable resources based on this topic. I chose to create this term with the help of my peers in order to share my definition of what computational dysmorphia means to me, which is a distortion of yourself; it's yet not a sickness; however, the algorithms are the vital reason for our distortions. This is why human-computer interaction and diverse data collection for training are very important .I want people to see the possibility of what happens when the LLM marks a nonmalicious intent.
