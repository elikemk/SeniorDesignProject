            What are the outcomes of simulated identical technology? Unmovingly, the rate of technological expansion is changing and evolving each day. Every day, we become an identity that is merged with programmatic models. This term is the same as body dysmorphia, where we think one thing about our body based on the beliefs and thoughts connected with our subconscious. Computational Dysmorphia is similar; it is a term coined to foster an ongoing trend where humans dissociate between their dependent identity-based on mass judgment and mass thought within online communities-and their pre-influencer identity, describing the psychological effects when interacting with curated digital environments and algorithms that distort how humans perceive their identity and what is worth. In all, Computational Dysmorphia is a phenomenon that leads to a distorted sense of self shaped by cultural trends and digital norms. The aim of this website is to introduce users to the phenomenon of interactiveness and artificial graphics and provide further valuable resources based on this topic. I decided to create this term with the help of my peers in order to share my definition of what computational dysmorphia means to me: a distortion of yourself; it's yet not a sickness; however, the algorithms are the vital reason for our distortions. That's why human-computer interaction and the creation of different datasets for training are so highly important. I want people to see what kind of possibility happens when LLM marks a nonmalicious intent.How does identity inspire identity when reality is on the side of dependent thinking? In a society growing around computational consumption and contiguous social media, algorithms are interesting to point out in the context of identifiable technology.
