Context
How can identity spark identity when reality favors dependent thinking? In a society that grows
around computational consumption and contiguous social media, algorithms are interesting to
point out in the context of identifiable technology. My question is: What are the outcomes of
simulated identical technology? Unmovingly, the rate of technological expansion is changing
and evolving each day. Every day, we become an identity that is merged with programmatic
models. This term is equivalent to body dysmorphia, where we think one thing about our body
based on the beliefs and thoughts tied to our subconscious. Computational Dysmorphia is
similar; it is a term created to foster an ongoing trend where humans Dissociation between their
dependent identity(identity-based on mass judgment and mass thought within online
communities) and their pre-influencer identity and describes the psychological effects when
interacting with curated digital environments and algorithms that distort how humans perceive
their identity and what is worth. In total, Computational Dysmorphia is a phenomenon that leads
to a distorted sense of self shaped by cultural trends and digital norms. The goal of this website
is to introduce users to the phenomenon of interactiveness and artificial graphics and provide
valuable resources based on this topic. I chose to create this term with the help of my peers in
order to share my definition of what computational dysmorphia means to me, which is a
distortion of yourself; it's yet not a sickness; however, the algorithms are the vital reason for our
distortions. This is why human-computer interaction and diverse data collection for training are
very important .I want people to see the possibility of what happens when the LLM marks a
nonmalicious intent.
Users will be prompted to enter the main page and enable their camera. An Facial Recognition
will appear on the screen and purposefully identify the users and any description. Users will
click next and be taken to a resources page or a aout page.

To get the properties of face recognition we used face-api-js
-
We want to identify a person based on the image and the input image.
-
Provide a reference of one or more person in the reference data, and then we connect
the reference data to the input image and if the image are similar enough return the
personâ€™s name otherwise the output is unknown.
Face api js have different face detectors
https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/index.html
face api js has a optimized tiny face detector and a multi task cascaded convolutional neural
network The face recognition used a resNet34r architecture and was trained to learn the
features of a human face.
